This project involves developing a game in JavaScript where monsters with defined lifespans and abilities drain life over time, 
using classes to manage game mechanics and async functions to handle game timing, demonstrating object-oriented programming and asynchronous JavaScript.

this project was super cool, however I do remember that it took forever to test each iteration because you had to wait until the end of the print statements to make sure that it all printing correctly. However most of the code was given to us.
